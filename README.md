# Meson Improvement Proposals (MIPs)

MIP stands for Meson Improvement Proposal. An MIP is a design document providing information to the Meson community, or describing a new feature for Meson or its processes or environment. The MIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The MIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

## The Meson Vision

Meson Network is committed to creating an efficient bandwidth marketplace on Web3, using a blockchain protocol model to replace the traditional labor-based sales models, consolidating and monetizing idle bandwidth from long-tail users at a low cost. Meson Network is the foundation of data transmission for decentralized storage, computation, and the emerging Web3 Dapp ecosystem.

## Meson Design Principles

The design of Meson is intended to follow a set of principles. The community will help define these principles in the coming months.

## Meson Improvement Principles

When making decisions about how to improve Meson, we will follow a set of principles. The community will help define these principles in the coming months.

## Making changes to the Meson Network

[Meson Improvement Proposals (MIPs)](https://github.com/daqnext/MIPs/blob/main/mip-1.md) are the primary mechanism by which the Meson community can submit, discuss, and approve changes relevant to the Meson Network. These discussions and decisions should be guided by the governance and design principles above.

MIPs are classified into three categories:

- A **Standards Track MIP** describes any change that affects most or all Meson implementations, such as—a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, proposed application standards/conventions, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Meson. Standards Track MIPs consist of three parts—a design document, an implementation, and (if warranted) an update to the formal specification. Furthermore, Standards Track MIPs can be broken down into the following categories:

- A **Meta MIP** describes a process surrounding Meson or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process MIPs are like Standards Track MIPs but apply to areas other than the Meson protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Meson's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational MIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Meson development. Any meta-MIP is also considered a Process MIP.

- An **Informational MIP** describes an Meson design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Meson community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational MIPs do not necessarily represent Meson community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational MIPs or follow their advice.
